/**
 `PSPDFAnnotationStateManager` holds the current annotation state and configures the associated `PSPDFViewController` to accept input related to the currently selected annotation state. The class also provides several convenience methods and user interface components required for annotation creation and configuration.

 Interested parties can register as the `stateDelegate` and / or use KVO to observer the manager's properties.

 You should never use more than one `PSPDFAnnotationStateManager` for any given `PSPDFViewController`. It's recommended to use `-[PSPDFViewController annotationStateManager]` instead of creating your own one in order to make sure this requirement is always met.

 `PSPDFAnnotationStateManager` is internally used by `PSPDFAnnotationToolbar` and can be re-used for any custom annotation related user interfaces.

 @note Do not create this class yourself. Use the existing class that is exposed in the `PSPDFViewController.`
