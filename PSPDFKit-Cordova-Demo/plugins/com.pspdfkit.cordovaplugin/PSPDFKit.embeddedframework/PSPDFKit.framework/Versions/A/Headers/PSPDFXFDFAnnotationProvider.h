/// Concrete implementation of the `PSPDFAnnotationProvider` protocol that uses a XFDF file as a source.
/// The XFDF file needs to be local and in a writable location, not on a web server.
/// This annotation provider handles data form fields according to the XFDF spec: "An XFDF file with form data contains form field names and values. When importing XFDF into Acrobat, the target PDF file must already contain the form fields. Importing XFDF updates the form field values in the PDF file. Exporting to XFDF puts the current value of the field in the value element. Using XFDF, it is not possible to create a new form field in a PDF document, or change anything other than the value of an existing form field."
/// It compliments an existing data form fields from PDF with values from the XFDF file. If data form field value is not found in the XFDF file it will be served by this provider with the default value.
/// @note Requires the `PSPDFFeatureMaskAnnotationEditing` feature flag.
